# Snow

## Installation

Snow simulation

Install this package with [quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa) by
evaluating the following code

```lisp
(quelpa '(snow :repo "EricCrosson/snow" :fetcher github))
```

Run this package by invoking the autoloaded command `M-x snow`.

## Usage

Whip up a snowstorm with `M-x snow` or

```lisp
(snow) ;; takes optional `seed'
```

To enter a specific seed: `C-u M-x snow RET <seed> RET`

## Improvements

The original idea for this package came from a bash script, seen on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8608226/simulate-bash-snow-fall-script-in-ncurses-c). One
day I found it remarkably strange that I only opened a terminal when I wanted to
watch the snow fall, and decided to implement snow natively inside my favorite
computing environment.

Along the way, the feature list has grown:
- [x] snow fall
- [x] documentation
- [x] debug mode
- [x] timestep counter
- [x] storms generated by random or user-entered seed
- [ ] snow collects on ground
- [ ] fastforward
- [ ] rewind
- [ ] jump to time
- [ ] transpose flurries
- [ ] wind gusts
- [ ] ground clusters
- [ ] worsening conditions on the cloud
- [ ] recognized keys in snow-mode
- [ ] hide snow-mode as an interactive function
- [ ] hide arrows on side of buffer (long-lines)
- [x] keep track of time snowed in
- [ ] achievements unlocked

## Thanks

Thanks to Kyle Jones for writing `life.el`, which I found very helpful to browse.
